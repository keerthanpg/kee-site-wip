The core idea is achieved by removing the license places and transmitting a dynamic ID via QR code or bluetooth becaons on car which can only be encrypted by authorised parties.

And it makes for really great TV. <br> This was an effort to analyze the debate show on India's most popular news channel in order to break it down to its most fundamental traits. This frustrating show effectively uses confusion and quarrel to establish false equivalencies and muddy the water, in any given debate. The main idea was to put numbers behind anecdotal claims so as to inspire a deeper study about the nature of 'Debate Shows' on Indian TV. Despite not being statistically significant, deep-diving into one debate efficiently brings forth the ideas to be further explored in an aggregate analysis.<br><br> <code>#chrome-extension #d3.js #javascript #html #css </code>",
